<h2>Description</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces/li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
  <li>4 cups lettuce leaves, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
  <li>1 cup grape tomatoes, halved</li>

</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
